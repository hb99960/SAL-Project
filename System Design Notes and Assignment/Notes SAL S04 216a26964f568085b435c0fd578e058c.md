# **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

## Simple Explanation

- A class should have **only one responsibility** or **one reason to change**.
- If a class handles multiple concerns (e.g., generating reports, saving to files, and printing), it violates SRP.
- Keeping one responsibility per class makes it easier to test, maintain, and reuse.

## How to Think About It

- Ask: “Can I summarize what this class does in one sentence?”
- If your answer contains “and” or “but,” the class may be doing too much.

## Identifying SRP Violations

- A class handles multiple unrelated tasks:
    - Saves data and sends emails
    - Fetches API and updates UI
- Changing one part of the class might break another
- Large classes with mixed responsibilities

## SRP Violation Example

```
class Report {
  generate(): string {
    return "Report Content";
  }

  print(report: string): void {
    console.log("Printing report:", report);
  }

  saveToFile(report: string): void {
    console.log("Saving report to disk:", report);
  }
}

```

- This class handles business logic, presentation, and persistence — violating SRP.

## SRP Compliant Version

```
class Report {
  generate(): string {
    return "Report Content";
  }
}

class ReportPrinter {
  print(content: string): void {
    console.log("Printing:", content);
  }
}

class ReportSaver {
  save(content: string): void {
    console.log("Saving to file:", content);
  }
}

```

- Each class now has one clear responsibility and one reason to change.

---

# **2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

## Simple Explanation

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.
- You should be able to add new behavior without changing existing code.

## How to Think About It

- Can you add new features by writing new code, without modifying existing tested code?
- Frequent edits to core logic for new use cases indicate a violation of OCP.

## Identifying OCP Violations

- Use of `if`, `else`, or `switch` based on types or behaviors
- Adding new features requires modifying existing classes
- Frequent bugs introduced during feature addition

## OCP Violation Example

```
class NotificationService {
  send(type: string, message: string): void {
    if (type === "email") {
      console.log(`Sending EMAIL: ${message}`);
    } else if (type === "sms") {
      console.log(`Sending SMS: ${message}`);
    }
  }
}

```

- Adding push notifications would require modifying the class, violating OCP.

## OCP Compliant Version

```
interface Notifier {
  send(message: string): void;
}

class EmailNotifier implements Notifier {
  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`Sending EMAIL: ${message}`);
  }
}

class SMSNotifier implements Notifier {
  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`Sending SMS: ${message}`);
  }
}

class NotificationService {
  constructor(private notifier: Notifier) {}

  notify(message: string) {
    this.notifier.send(message);
  }
}

const emailService = new NotificationService(new EmailNotifier());
emailService.notify("Welcome!");

const smsService = new NotificationService(new SMSNotifier());
smsService.notify("OTP: 1234");

```

- New behavior can be added using a new class like `PushNotifier` without changing existing logic.

---

# **3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

## Simple Explanation

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- A derived class should be able to **replace its base class** without breaking functionality.

## How to Think About It

- Is the subclass truly a **"is-a"** relationship?
- Is the subclass violating expectations of the parent class?

## Identifying LSP Violations

- Subclass throws errors for parent methods
- Subclass adds conditionals to avoid executing parent behavior

## LSP Violation Example

```
class MediaPlayer {
  playAudio(): void {
    console.log("Playing audio");
  }

  playVideo(): void {
    console.log("Playing video");
  }
}

class AudioPlayer extends MediaPlayer {
  playVideo(): void {
    throw new Error("Audio player can't play video");
  }
}

```

## LSP Compliant Version

```
interface AudioPlayable {
  playAudio(): void;
}

interface VideoPlayable extends AudioPlayable {
  playVideo(): void;
}

class AudioPlayer implements AudioPlayable {
  playAudio(): void {
    console.log("Playing audio only");
  }
}

class FullMediaPlayer implements VideoPlayable {
  playAudio(): void {
    console.log("Playing audio");
  }

  playVideo(): void {
    console.log("Playing video");
  }
}

```

- Each type now follows its intended interface without breaking behavior.

---

# **4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

## Simple Explanation

- Do not force a class to implement interfaces it does not use.
- Prefer **multiple small interfaces** over a single large one.

## ISP Violation Example

```
interface Machine {
  print(): void;
  scan(): void;
  fax(): void;
}

class OldPrinter implements Machine {
  print() {
    console.log("Printing...");
  }

  scan() {
    throw new Error("Scan not supported");
  }

  fax() {
    throw new Error("Fax not supported");
  }
}

```

## ISP Compliant Version

```
interface Printer {
  print(): void;
}

interface Scanner {
  scan(): void;
}

interface Fax {
  fax(): void;
}

class SimplePrinter implements Printer {
  print() {
    console.log("Printing...");
  }
}

class MultiFunctionPrinter implements Printer, Scanner, Fax {
  print() {
    console.log("Printing...");
  }

  scan() {
    console.log("Scanning...");
  }

  fax() {
    console.log("Faxing...");
  }
}

```

- Now, classes implement only what they need.

---

# **5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## Simple Explanation

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
- Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## What Is a Dependency?

- A class depends on another class/service to do its job.
- Example: A service class depending on a database class.

## Without DIP

- Tight coupling between business logic and specific implementations.
- Changing the low-level module (like the database) breaks the high-level module.

## DIP Violation Example

```
class MySQLDatabase {
  save(data: string) {
    console.log("Saving to MySQL:", data);
  }
}

class UserService {
  db = new MySQLDatabase();

  registerUser(data: string) {
    this.db.save(data);
  }
}

```

- `UserService` is tightly coupled to `MySQLDatabase`.

## DIP Compliant Version

```
interface Database {
  save(data: string): void;
}

class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
  save(data: string) {
    console.log("Saving to MySQL:", data);
  }
}

class MongoDB implements Database {
  save(data: string) {
    console.log("Saving to MongoDB:", data);
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private db: Database) {}

  registerUser(data: string) {
    this.db.save(data);
  }
}

const mysql = new MySQLDatabase();
const userService = new UserService(mysql);
userService.registerUser("John Doe");

```

- Now `UserService` depends on the abstraction `Database`, not on a specific database class.

## Related Concept: Dependency Injection (DI)

- A technique to provide dependencies from outside rather than creating them inside.
- Common types of DI:
    - Constructor Injection
    - Setter Injection
    - Interface Injection

# **Strategy Design Pattern**

## **Problem Statement**

You are building an e-commerce platform that initially had **Credit Card Payments**. As the platform expanded, the team added support for **PayPal**, **Stripe**, **Bitcoin**, and **Apple Pay**.

Initially, all payment methods were implemented inside one class: `PaymentProcessor`. As new payment options were added, this class became:

- Large and difficult to maintain
- Prone to bugs when changes were made
- Hard to extend without modifying the original logic

**Result:** The team faced merge conflicts, slow reviews, and high maintenance effort.

---

## **Core Requirements**

1. The system should support **multiple payment methods**.
2. It should be **easy to add new strategies** without modifying existing code.
3. **Maintainability** and **extensibility** are top priorities.

---

## **Strategy Pattern: Simple Definition**

Strategy Pattern is a **behavioral design pattern** that:

- Allows you to define a **family of algorithms** (or behaviors)
- Encapsulates each algorithm inside its own class
- Enables the **interchangeability** of these algorithms at runtime

**In short:** *Do the same thing (e.g., processing payment) in different ways (Card, UPI, PayPal, etc.).*

---

## **Goal-Oriented Client Code**

Before diving into the full structure, understand how the client is expected to use the system:

```
const processor = new Payment(new CardPayment());
processor.process(100);

processor.setStrategy(new UPIPayment());
processor.process(200);

```

**Key Idea:** You can swap strategies at runtime without changing the logic in `Payment`.

---

## **Code Implementation**

### Step 1: Define a `PaymentStrategy` Interface

```
interface PaymentStrategy {
    performPayment(amount: number): void;
}

```

This acts as a **contract** that all payment strategies must follow.

---

### Step 2: Create Concrete Strategies

```
class CardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    performPayment(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Rs.${amount} Payment performed using Card`);
    }
}

class UPIPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    performPayment(amount: number): void {
        console.log(`Rs.${amount} Payment performed using UPI`);
    }
}

```

Each class has its own logic for handling payments.

---

### Step 3: Build the Context Class

```
class Payment {
    paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy;

    constructor(paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    setStrategy(paymentStrategy: PaymentStrategy): void {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    process(amount: number): void {
        this.paymentStrategy.performPayment(amount);
    }
}

```

This is the **context** that uses any payment strategy object.

---

### Step 4: Use the Pattern

```
const processor = new Payment(new CardPayment());
processor.process(100); // Card

processor.setStrategy(new UPIPayment());
processor.process(200); // UPI

```

---

## **Class Diagram Overview**

**Participants:**

- `Payment` → Uses the strategy
- `PaymentStrategy` → Interface
- `CardPayment`, `UPIPayment`, etc. → Concrete implementations

---

## **Real-World Applications**

- **Payment Gateways**: Card, UPI, PayPal, Stripe
- **Authentication**: Google, Facebook, Email login
- **Shipping Options**: Standard, Express, Overnight
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
- **Pricing Logic**: Normal, Discounted, Premium pricing

---

## **Benefits**

1. Can **switch algorithms** at runtime without affecting client code.
2. Encourages **Open/Closed Principle**: Add new strategies without modifying existing logic.
3. Reduces **code duplication** by separating algorithm implementations.
4. Promotes **composition over inheritance**.

---

## **Limitations**

1. If only 2–3 strategies are required, it might be **overkill**.
2. For simple variations, **functional programming** (e.g., passing a function as a parameter) might be better.
3. **Too many classes**: Every new strategy adds a new file or class.

---

## **Developer Tips**

- Follow a clean folder structure:
    - `/src` for TypeScript source files
    - `/dist` for compiled JavaScript files
- While combining all logic in one file is possible, using **separate files for each strategy** improves readability and maintainability.
- Use interfaces to **enforce contracts** and ensure all strategies follow the same method structure.

# Assignment S04

Here are **7 coding questions** (max as requested), each clearly marked and covering **SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP, and Strategy Pattern** with varied difficulty levels.

---

### 

**Problem:**
You are given the following class:

```
class TaskManager {
  createTask(name: string) {
    console.log(`Creating task: ${name}`);
  }

  sendEmail(to: string) {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${to}`);
  }
}

```

**Task:**
Refactor the code to follow the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

---

### 

**Problem:**
You are building a shipping cost calculator:

```
class Shipping {
  calculate(type: string): number {
    if (type === "standard") return 50;
    if (type === "express") return 100;
    return 0;
  }
}

```

**Task:**
Refactor the code using the **Open/Closed Principle** so that new shipping types can be added without modifying the `Shipping` class.

---

### 

**Problem:**
Consider the following inheritance setup:

```
class Bird {
  fly(): void {
    console.log("Flying...");
  }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
  fly(): void {
    throw new Error("Ostriches can't fly!");
  }
}

```

**Task:**
Identify the Liskov Substitution Principle violation and fix the design.

---

### 

**Problem:**
You are modeling a device interface:

```
interface Device {
  print(): void;
  scan(): void;
  fax(): void;
}

```

**Task:**
Refactor this interface to follow the **Interface Segregation Principle** and create two classes:

- `OldPrinter` (can only print)
- `SmartPrinter` (can print, scan, and fax)

---

### 

**Problem:**
Your current implementation is:

```
class MySQLService {
  save(data: string) {
    console.log("Saving to MySQL:", data);
  }
}

class UserService {
  db = new MySQLService();

  register(user: string) {
    this.db.save(user);
  }
}

```

**Task:**
Refactor the above to follow the **Dependency Inversion Principle** using an interface `Database`.

---

### 

**Problem:**
Build a payment processing system that supports:

- Card Payment
- UPI Payment
- Bitcoin Payment

Each should follow a common `PaymentStrategy` interface.

**Task:**
Implement the **Strategy Pattern** so that you can dynamically change the payment strategy using:

```
const payment = new Payment(new CardPayment());
payment.process(1000);

payment.setStrategy(new BitcoinPayment());
payment.process(2000);

```

---

**Problem:**
You are given the following structure:

```
class Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Some sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Bark!");
  }
}

```

**Task:**
Demonstrate **runtime polymorphism** by creating a `makeAnimalSound` function that accepts an `Animal` type and shows how substituting a `Dog` object still works.

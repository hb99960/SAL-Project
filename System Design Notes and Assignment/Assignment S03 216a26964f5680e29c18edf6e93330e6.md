# Assignment S03

Here are **6 coding questions** based on the shared OOP TypeScript code, structured into three levels of difficulty:

---

## ✅ **Level 0 – Beginner (3 Questions)**

### **Q1: Basic Inheritance**

**Problem:**
Create a `Duck` class with a method `swim()` that logs `"I know swimming"` to the console. Create a `MallardDuck` class that extends `Duck` and inherits the `swim()` method.
**Expected Output:**

```
I know swimming

```

---

### **Q2: Method Overriding Basics**

**Problem:**
Create a parent class `Bird` with a method `fly()` that logs `"I can fly"`.
Create a child class `Penguin` that overrides the `fly()` method to log `"I cannot fly"`.
Instantiate both classes and call `fly()` on both objects.
**Expected Output:**

```
I can fly
I cannot fly

```

---

### **Q3: Interface Implementation**

**Problem:**
Create an interface `IDuck` with methods `swim()`, `fly()`, and `sound()`.
Implement a class `ToyDuck` that logs:

- `"Cannot fly"`
- `"Cannot sound"`
- `"Can float on water"`**Expected Output:**

```
Cannot fly
Cannot sound
Can float on water

```

## ✅ **Level 1 – Intermediate (2 Questions)**

### **Q4: Polymorphism – Duck Family**

**Problem:**
Define a base class `PolyDuck` with a `fly()` method.
Create 3 child classes (`DesiDuck`, `VidesiDuck`, `SmartDuck`) that override `fly()` with different speeds.
Create a function `makeDuckFly(duck: PolyDuck)` that accepts any duck and calls its `fly()` method.
Use this function to test each duck.
**Expected Output:**

```
DesiDuck flies at 10kmph
VidesiDuck flies at 20kmph
SmartDuck flies at 50kmph

```

### **Q5: Access Modifiers Exploration**

**Problem:**
Create a `User` class with the following:

- `public name`
- `private orgCode = "DuckCorp"`
- `protected role`
Constructor should accept `name` and `role`.
Add a method `introduce()` that logs: `I am {name} from {orgCode}`
Create a `Manager` class that extends `User`, and adds a method `getRole()` that logs the role.
Instantiate both and test their methods.
Try accessing `orgCode` directly (expect compile error).
**Expected Output:**

```
I am Daffy from DuckCorp
Manager

```

---

## ✅ **Level 2 – Advanced (1 Question)**

### **Q6: Dynamic Duck Behavior Simulator**

**Problem:**
You are building a Duck Simulator. Implement the Strategy Pattern.

1. Create an interface `FlyStrategy` with method `fly()`
2. Implement two strategies: `FastFly` and `NoFly`
3. Create a `Duck` class that accepts a `FlyStrategy` and uses it in a `performFly()` method
4. Add a `setFlyStrategy()` method to change flying behavior at runtime
5. Test with:

```
const duck = new Duck(new FastFly());
duck.performFly(); // Fast flying
duck.setFlyStrategy(new NoFly());
duck.performFly(); // Cannot fly

```

**Expected Output:**

```
Flying fast like a rocket!
I cannot fly

```

## 1.0 OOPs

1.1 Why do we need OOPs?

Object Oriented Programming (OOPS)

Imagine you're working on a system where you need to represent many **people** (with properties like `name` and `interest`). Initially, you may start by using variables or objects, but as your system grows, you'll start encountering **problems** related to **efficiency**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**. This is where OOPS come in, offering a structured, reusable, and organized way to model your data.

```jsx
// Method-1 : Wthout classes : just using variables
let name1= "Venu";
let interest1 = "Backend";

let name2 = "Dinkar";
let interest2 = "Data Analysis";

let name3 = "Ankit";
let interest3 = "Data Stucture";
// Limitation : This method is okay for a small amount of data, but as your app grows, it becomes cumbersome and inefficient.

//Method-2 : using JS object
// Repeating structure manually
let person1 = {
  name: "Venu",
  interest: "Backend",
  introduce: function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I like ${this.interest}.`);
  },
};

let person2 = {
  name: "Dinkar",
  interest: "Data Analysis",
  introduce: function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I like ${this.interest}.`);
  },
};

person1.introduce(); // Hi, I'm Venu and I like Backend.
person2.introduce(); // Hi, I'm Dinkar and I like Data Analysis.

// Limitation :While using objects is an improvement over variables, you still lack a reusable template for creating and managing people efficiently.

🔴 Problems:
Duplicated method code
No template
Easy to miss fields or introduce typos

// Method-3 using JS Prototypes
function Person(name, interest) {
  this.name = name;
  this.interest = interest;
}

Person.prototype.introduce = function () {
  console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I like ${this.interest}.`);
};

let person1 = new Person("Venu", "Backend");
let person2 = new Person("Dinkar", "Data Analysis");

person1.introduce(); // Hi, I'm Venu and I like Backend.
person2.introduce(); // Hi, I'm Dinkar and I like Data Analysis.

Improvements:
Shared method via prototype
Efficient memory usage
⚠️ Limitations:
Verbose and lower readability
No type safety
Beginners may find it unintuitive

You can use Class to create as many objects as you want
✅ Benefits:
Clean syntax
Type safety (in TypeScript)
Easy to scale
IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring)
```

What you need is some kind of template which can be reused again. But the important thing is how to create that template (technically class)?? In the above example, two properties i.e. name and interest is getting repeated for every Person so this we can generalise. After this we need to provide the syntax of class. 

```jsx
// Two Important things : 
// 1. ClassName should start with capital.
// 2. ClassName and FileName should be same (Good coding practice)

class ClassName {

  // Properties or member variables
  propertyName: type;

  // Constructor to create the objects
  constructor(parameter1: type, parameter2: type) {
    
    // Initialize properties
    this.propertyName = parameter1;
    // more initialization...
  }

  // Method or member functions
  methodName(): returnType {
    // method body
    return value;
  }
}
```

## What are Classes?

- Classes are the blueprint of objects.
- **Classes** help you model real-world entities in your code by **generalizing** the properties and behaviors into a reusable template.
- Instead of manually managing individual properties or creating repetitive objects, classes provide a structured, maintainable way to manage and manipulate your data.
- Classes allow for easy **scalability**, **flexibility**, and **organization** of your code, making it **easy to expand** as your system grows.

### How to create a class?

- Identify the variables and behaviours which are repeating.
- Generalise them by wrapping them into class.

```jsx
class Person {

		// member variables which are repeating
		name:string;
		interest: string;

		// Constructor : to initialise the values of variables
    constructor(name, interest) {
        this.name = name;
        this.interest = interest;
    }
    
}

let person1 = new Person("Venu", "Backend");
let person2 = new Person("Dinkar", "Data Analysis");
let person3 = new Person("Ankit", "Data Structure");
```

### What is constructor?

Constructors in TypeScript are special functions used to initialize objects when they are created from a class. When you define a class, the constructor allows you to **set initial values** for the object's properties. Without a constructor, the object would be created with default or uninitialized values, which could lead to errors or inefficiency in your application.

1. **Initializing Values**: When you create an instance of a class, the constructor allows you to pass values and initialize the object’s fields (properties). For example, in a `Person` class, the constructor might take values for `name` and `interest` to set them up when creating each `Person` object.
2. **"this" Keyword**: Inside the constructor, the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It helps to assign values to the object's properties. `this.name = name` assigns the passed `name` value to the object's `name` field.

In summary, the **constructor** is crucial because it initializes the object's properties, making it ready for use. It’s like setting the initial state for an object when it’s created, ensuring that it has the required values and functionality from the start.

### Explain this keyword using memory Representation.

```jsx
Memory for `person1`:
+-----------------------+
|    name: "Venu"       |  <-- this.name = "Venu"
|    interest: "Backend" |  <-- this.interest = "Backend"
+-----------------------+
      ^ (this points here)

Memory for `person2`:
+---------------------------+
|    name: "Ankit"          |  <-- this.name = "Ankit"
|    interest: "Data Structures" |  <-- this.interest = "Data Structures"
+---------------------------+
      ^ (this points here)
      this points to person1 or person2? person2 is the answer
```

### How to create Object?

```jsx
let p1 = new Person("Avinash", "Java Backend");v
// new keyword : triggers the constructor
```

Creating objects of a class in TypeScript is a straightforward process that allows you to instantiate objects based on the class template. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Use the `new` Keyword**: To create an object from a class, you need to use the `new` keyword followed by the class name. This triggers the constructor function of the class and creates a new instance of that class.
2. **Pass Values to Constructor**: If the class has a constructor that takes parameters (e.g., `name`, `interest`), you pass the necessary values when creating the object. These values will initialise the object’s properties.
3. **Access Object Properties**: Once the object is created, you can access its properties and methods using dot notation. The object now contains the values you initialized through the constructor.
4. **Multiple Instances**: You can create as many objects as needed from the same class, with different values for their properties. Each object will be a separate instance with its own state.

### Function inside Class

```jsx
class Person {

		// member variables which are repeating
		name:string;
		interest: string;

		// Constructor function: to initialise the values of variables
    constructor(name, interest) {
        this.name = name;
        this.interest = interest;
    }
    
    // Member Function : Person also performs some actions like talking : introduce yourself
    introduce() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am interested in ${this.interest}.`);
    }
}

let person1 = new Person("Venu", "Backend");
let person2 = new Person("Dinkar", "Data Analysis");
let person3 = new Person("Ankit", "Data Structure");

person1.introduce();  // Output: Hello, my name is Venu and I am interested in Backend.
person2.introduce();  // Output: Hello, my name is Dinkar and I am interested in Data Analysis.##
```

## 2.0 Inheritance

### 2.1 Need -> Coding of Inheritance

```jsx
// class with methods (swim, sound, fly)
class IndianDuck{
    swim():void{
        console.log("I know siwmming");
    }

    sound():void{
        console.log("Quack!! Quack!!");
    }

    fly():void{
        console.log("I fly at 10 kmph");
    }

}

// class with methods (swim, sound, fly)
class AmericanDuck{
    swim():void{
        console.log("I know siwmming");
    }

    sound():void{
        console.log("Quack!! Quack!!");
    }

    fly():void{
        console.log("I fly at 5kmph");
    }
}

// Now user want to create a new class of AfricanDuck. But there is problem 
// with this approach. What is it?
// Duplication of Efforts : You have to 
// What is the solution?
```

### 2.1 What is Inheritance?

- Class based inheritance is syntactic sugar of prototype-based inheritance.
    - Under the hood, Class use prototype-based inheritance.

```jsx
Solution is Inheritance

// Parent class
class Duck{

    swim():void{
        console.log("I know siwmming");
    }

    sound():void{
        console.log("Quack!! Quack!!");
    }
    
    fly():void{
        console.log("I fly at xkmph");
    }
}

//Child class
class IndianDuck extends Duck{

}

//Child class
class AmericanDuck extends Duck{

}

let indianDuck = new IndianDuck();
indianDuck.sound();
indianDuck.swim();
indianDuck.fly();

// child class
class AfricanDuck extends Duck{
fly():void{
        console.log("I fly at 15kmph");
    }
}
```

```jsx
// Parent Class
class Duck {
  name: string;
  interest: string;

  constructor(name: string, interest: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.interest = interest;
  }

  // Method in Parent class
  swim(): string {
    return `${this.name} is swimming!`;
  }

  // Method in Parent class
  performFly(): string {
    return `${this.name} is flying!`;
  }

  // Method in Parent class
  makeSound(): string {
    return `${this.name} is quacking!`;
  }

  // New method added to the Parent class
  quack(): string {
    return `${this.name} is quacking loudly!`;
  }
}

// Child Class 1: MallardDuck
class MallardDuck extends Duck {
  constructor(name: string, interest: string) {
    super(name, interest);  // Inheriting constructor from Parent class
  }

  // Method Overriding (same name as Parent class)
  makeSound(): string {
    return `${this.name} is quacking loudly!`;  // Overridden method
  }

  // Adding a new method specific to MallardDuck
  fly(): string {
    return `${this.name} is flying fast!`;  // New method in Child class
  }
}

// Child Class 2: WoodenDuck
class WoodenDuck extends Duck {
  constructor(name: string, interest: string) {
    super(name, interest);  // Inheriting constructor from Parent class
  }

  // Method Overriding (same name as Parent class)
  makeSound(): string {
    return `${this.name} makes a squeaky sound!`;  // Overridden method
  }

  // Adding a new method specific to WoodenDuck
  fly(): string {
    return `${this.name} cannot fly!`;  // New method in Child class
  }
}

// Create instances of each duck type
let mallardDuck = new MallardDuck("Mallard", "Swimming");
let woodenDuck = new WoodenDuck("Wooden", "No interest");

// Demonstrating Parent Class Methods
console.log(mallardDuck.swim());         // Output: Mallard is swimming!
console.log(mallardDuck.performFly());  // Output: Mallard is flying!
console.log(mallardDuck.makeSound());   // Output: Mallard is quacking loudly!
console.log(mallardDuck.quack());       // Output: Mallard is quacking loudly!
console.log(mallardDuck.fly());         // Output: Mallard is flying fast!

console.log(woodenDuck.swim());         // Output: Wooden is swimming!
console.log(woodenDuck.performFly());  // Output: Wooden is flying!
console.log(woodenDuck.makeSound());   // Output: Wooden makes a squeaky sound!
console.log(woodenDuck.quack());       // Output: Wooden is quacking loudly!
console.log(woodenDuck.fly());         // Output: Wooden cannot fly!
```

### Method Overloading

```tsx
class Greeter {
  // Overload signatures
  greet(name: string): string;
  greet(age: number): string;

  // Single implementation
  greet(input: string | number): string {
    if (typeof input === "string") {
      return `Hello, ${input}!`;
    } else {
      return `You are ${input} years old.`;
    }
  }
}

const g = new Greeter();

console.log(g.greet("Alice")); // Hello, Alice!
console.log(g.greet(25));      // You are 25 years old.
```

### Public, Private, Protected Keyword

## **1. `public`** (Default)

- Accessible **everywhere**: inside the class, outside the class, and in child classes.
- If you don’t write anything, it's treated as `public` by default.

### ✅ Example:

```tsx
class Person {
  public name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const p = new Person("Alice");
console.log(p.name); // ✅ Accessible
p.greet();           // ✅ Accessible

```

---

## **2. `private`**

- Accessible **only inside the same class**.
- ❌ Not accessible from outside or by child classes.
- Use when you want to **hide internal details** of a class.

### ✅ Example:

```tsx
class Person {
  private ssn: string;

  constructor(ssn: string) {
    this.ssn = ssn;
  }

  private logSSN() {
    console.log(`SSN: ${this.ssn}`);
  }
}

const p = new Person("123-45-6789");

```

---

## **3. `protected`**

- Accessible **inside the class** and in its **child classes**.
- Not accessible from outside the class.
- Use when you want to expose something only to inherited classes.

### ✅ Example:

```tsx
class Person {
  protected department: string;

  constructor(department: string) {
    this.department = department;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  showDepartment() {
    console.log(`Department: ${this.department}`); //
  }
}

const emp = new Employee("Engineering");
// console.log(emp.department);  
emp.showDepartment();           

```

---

## 🧠 Summary Table:

| Modifier | Accessible in Class | Accessible in Child Class | Accessible Outside Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `private` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `protected` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

### ### Types of Inheritance

1. Single Inheritance
2. Multi-level Inheritance
3. Hierarchical inheritance

Important Questions (Can ask to make them curious) 

- What is Parent Class and Child Class in the above code??
    - Child classes : Both classes will have the functions of Parent class
- **Can we add new functions in the Child class?**
    - Yes, Child classes can **add new methods** that are specific to that class and are not present in the Parent class.
    - In the example above, both `MallardDuck` and `WoodenDuck` have added their own specific `fly()` methods.
- **Can we have a function with the same name as in the Parent?**
    - Yes, this is called **method overriding**. If a function in the Child class has the same name as the function in the Parent class, the **Child class method** will override the Parent class method.
    - **Example**: Both `MallardDuck` and `WoodenDuck` override the `makeSound()` method. The Child class’s method will be the one that gets called when invoked on an instance of that Child class.
- What will happen in second question, Which definition will work : Parent or child class? child class
    - method over-riding
- **Which function definition will be used when overridden? Parent or Child class?**
    - The **Child class’s method** will be used if it overrides a method from the Parent class. This is known as **method overriding**.
    - **Example**: If you create an instance of `MallardDuck` and call `makeSound()`, it will use the `makeSound()` method from `MallardDuck` rather than the Parent `Duck` class, because the method was overridden in the Child class.
- **Can we add new functions to all the ducks?**
    - Yes, by adding a new method to the Parent class, you can have all Child classes inherit this method. Alternatively, you can define specific new methods in each Child class to customize behavior.

## 3.0 Interface

### 3.1 Need of Interface

In TypeScript, interfaces provide a way to define **contract-based functionality** without enforcing a concrete definition. This is useful when you want to ensure that different classes share the same structure or behavior without dictating how they implement the actual functionality. Essentially, interfaces define **what** needs to be done but leave **how** it is done to the implementing classes.

```jsx
interface Duck {
  swim(): void;    // Every duck must implement swim
  sound(): void;   // Every duck must implement sound
  fly(): void;     // Every duck must implement fly
}

class MallardDuck implements Duck {
  swim(): void {
    console.log("Mallard Duck is swimming.");
  }

  sound(): void {
    console.log("Mallard Duck says Quack!");
  }

  fly(): void {
    console.log("Mallard Duck is flying!");
  }
}

class WoodenDuck implements Duck {
  swim(): void {
    console.log("Wooden Duck is floating.");
  }

  sound(): void {
    console.log("Wooden Duck makes a squeaky sound.");
  }

  fly(): void {
    console.log("Wooden Duck cannot fly.");
  }
}

```

### **Scenario**:

Suppose you need some functionality in your application, but you don’t want to dictate the exact implementation details for all the objects. In this case, you can use an **interface** to define the **expected methods** that any class should implement, without specifying the concrete implementation.

### **Can You Create Objects from an Interface?**

- **No**, interfaces cannot be instantiated. They are **not meant to hold data** but rather to define the structure that a class must implement. You cannot create an object directly from an interface **because it doesn't provide any implementation**—only a contract for what needs to be implemented.

### **Limitations of Interfaces**:

**Forces You to Define All Methods**:

- An interface in TypeScript forces you to **implement all methods** defined in it, regardless of whether your class actually needs them. This can lead to **redundancy** if some methods don't apply to certain classes or are not used, which makes your code unnecessarily verbose.

**Example**: If you define an interface with methods that don't apply to certain classes, TypeScript will still require you to provide implementations for those methods.

### 3.2 Inheritance vs Interface

- **Inheritance**:
    - **Code reuse**: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from the parent class.
    - **Extend functionality**: Child classes can add or modify the functionality inherited from the parent class.
    - **Flexible behavior**: Parent class methods can be overridden in the child class.
- **Interface**:
    - **No code reuse**: Interfaces don't provide implementation; they only define method signatures.
    - **Mandatory method definitions**: Classes implementing the interface must define all the methods specified in the interface.
    - **No flexibility in fields**: Interfaces cannot contain fields or state, only methods.

| Inheritance  | Interface |
| --- | --- |
| All methods are concrete | All methods are abstract |
| Template to create another objects with same states and behaviours | Contract : that all other classes will surely have these methods but can have different implementation |
| Tight Coupling | Loose Coupling |

### 3.3 Closure : Classes, Inheritance, Interface

### How OOPs will help in System Design?

- **Inheritance**:
    - **When to choose**: Use inheritance when you need to **reuse code** or **extend functionality**. It allows a child class to inherit common behavior (methods and properties) from a parent class, promoting **code reusability** and **maintainability**.
- **Interface**:
    - **When to choose**: Use interfaces when you want to **define a contract** for behavior. Interfaces ensure that any class implementing them provides certain methods, allowing for **consistency** across different classes without enforcing implementation details. Ideal when you need **flexibility** in how methods are implemented.
- Design decisions :
    - If you need flexibility either go for abstract class or interface.
    - If you need to reuse the code go for inheritance.

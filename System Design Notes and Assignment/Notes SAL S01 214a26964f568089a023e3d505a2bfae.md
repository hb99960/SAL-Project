# Student Notes: S01 ‚Äì System Design + TypeScript

---

## 1.0 Introduction to System Design

### Why Learn System Design?

- Can your app handle **10,000+ users**?
- System Design = Designing **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **reliable** software systems.
- Think IRCTC, Swiggy, UPI, BookMyShow ‚Üí **They crash when poorly designed**.

### What Makes a Good System?

| Factor | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Scalable | Handles growth: users, data, traffic (e.g. replicas, DB choice) |
| Maintainable | Modular, testable, DRY, good docs |
| Reliable | Fault ‚â† Failure. Handle faults via **fault-tolerant design** |

> Fault = Something went wrong
Failure = Complete system breakdown
> 

### Two Layers of System Design:

| Layer | Focus | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HLD | High-level Architecture | Servers, Load Balancers, Caching, DB choices |
| LLD | Code-level Structure | Classes, Interfaces, Design Principles & OOP |

> E.g. Swiggy, Uber, Ola, IRCTC

## 2.0 Introduction to TypeScript

### Activity: Compare JS vs TS

- **TS has more keywords**, but...
- TS is more **predictable** and **less error-prone**

### üí° Why TypeScript?

| Reason | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| Type Safety | Errors caught **before** running code (compile-time) |
| Tooling | Better autocompletion, IntelliSense, and refactoring support |
| OOP Support | Supports **classes**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **modularity** |

### Example:

```tsx
class User {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, I‚Äôm ${this.name}`);
  }
}

```

---

### What is TypeScript?

| Aspect | TypeScript |
| --- | --- |
| Is | A **superset** of JS that adds static typing |
| Is NOT | A replacement for JavaScript |
| Compatibility | Every valid JS code = valid TS code |
| Transpilation | TS ‚Üí JS before running |

---

### Getting Started with TypeScript

### Initialize TS Project

```bash
npm init -y
npm install -g typescript
tsc --init

```

### `tsconfig.json` Example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2016",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "strict": true
  }
}

```

### üë£ Steps:

1. Code in `src/index.ts`
2. Transpile with `tsc`
3. Run `node dist/index.js`

---

### Transpilation vs Compilation

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Compilation | Code ‚Üí Machine Language |
| Transpilation | Code ‚Üí Another High-level Language (TS ‚Üí JS) |

### Workflow:

```bash
tsc index.ts   # TS ‚Üí JS
node index.js  # Run JS

```

---

## 3.0 TypeScript Types

### Common Types

```
let name: string = "Masai";
let age: number = 10;
let isActive: boolean = true;
let scores: number[] = [90, 85, 70];

let user: { id: number; name: string } = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice"
};

```

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| string | Text data |
| number | Numbers |
| boolean | true/false |
| array | List of typed items |
| object | Custom structured data |
| any | Turns off type checking |

---

### üîç Compilation vs Runtime Errors

| Error Type | When It Occurs | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compilation Error | During transpilation | `let count: number = "hello";` |
| Runtime Error | When running code | `console.log(undefinedVar.prop);` |

---

## 3.1 Important & Interview-Focused Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `null` | Explicit absence of value (`let a: number \| null = null`) |
| `undefined` | Declared but not assigned |
| `void` | No return from a function |
| `any` | Disables type safety ‚Äì use **only** if needed |
| `unknown` | Like `any`, but forces **type checking** before using the value |

### Example:

```tsx
function sayHi(): void {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

let a: any = "test";
a = 10; // no error

let b: unknown = "safe";
if (typeof b === "string") {
  console.log(b.toUpperCase());
}

```

---

## ‚úç Summary

- **System Design** teaches how to **scale** apps for real-world use.
- **TypeScript** = JavaScript + Types
    - Catches bugs early
    - Makes code predictable
    - Adds structure with OOP principles
- Use types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.) to write **safe, readable code**.
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when dealing with uncertain data types.

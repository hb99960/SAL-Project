## **Problem Statement: Tic-Tac-Toe (Diagonal-Lock Variant)**

### **Objective**

Develop a **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe variant** where two players take turns marking cells on a **3x3 grid**, with a **special diagonal lock rule**. Players must register with **unique names and symbols**, and the game should validate all moves, detect winners, and announce results.

---

### **Functional Requirements**

---

### **1. Game Board Setup**

- The board is a **3x3 grid**, with rows labeled `A, B, C` and columns numbered `1, 2, 3`.
- All cells should **start empty (`_`)**.
- The board should update and display after each valid move.

---

### **2. Player Registration**

- Two players must enter their **names** and **symbols** (e.g., `X`, `O`) at the start.
- The game should ensure:
    - Symbols are **not the same**.
    - Symbols are **not `_`** (reserved for empty cells).

---

### **3. Gameplay Mechanics**

- Players take turns by entering a **box coordinate** (e.g., `A1`, `C2`).
- If a player tries to **mark an already filled cell**, the move is rejected with an error.
- Turns alternate automatically after a successful move.

---

### **4. Special Rule: Diagonal Lock**

- If a player marks both diagonal corners (i.e., cells `A1` and `C3`, or `A3` and `C1`) **with their character**, the **center cell `B2` is locked** for the opponent and can only be claimed by the same player.
- If the center cell is already taken, the rule has no effect.

---

### **5. Win Conditions**

A player **wins** if:

- They place **three of their symbols** in:
    - Any row (e.g., `XXX` in `B`)
    - Any column (e.g., `OOO` in column `3`)
    - Any diagonal

---

### **6. Draw Condition**

- If **all 9 cells are filled** and no one wins, the game ends in a **draw**.

---

### **7. Error Handling**

- Invalid input like `D4`, `A0`, or any coordinate out of bounds should throw an error.
- If a player tries to use `_` as their symbol, show an error.
- If players select the **same symbol**, prompt them to re-enter.

---

### **Constraints & Rules**

- Board size is **fixed at 3x3**.
- Undoing moves is **not allowed**.
- The game is **console-based only**.
- The **diagonal lock rule is optional to trigger** based on moves.
- Once a game ends (win or draw), no further input should be accepted.

### ðŸ’¡ Example Scenario

1. Player 1 picks `X`, Player 2 picks `O`.
2. Player 1 marks `A1`, then `C3`.
3. The game now **locks `B2`** â€” only Player 1 can mark it.
4. If Player 2 tries to play `B2`, an error is shown.

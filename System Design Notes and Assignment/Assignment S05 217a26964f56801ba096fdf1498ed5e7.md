# Assignment S05

### **Q1: Class Inside Another Class**

**Problem Statement:**

Create two classes:

- `Engine` with method `start()` that logs `"Engine started"`.
- `Car` that contains an object of `Engine` and a method `drive()` which first calls `engine.start()` and then logs `"Car is driving"`.

**Task:**
Demonstrate how one class using another's functionality **directly** is an example of **tight coupling**.

**Expected Output:**

```
Engine started
Car is driving

```

---

### **Q2: Replace Class with Interface**

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a tightly coupled `Car` class that uses an `Engine` class directly.

Refactor this to use an interface `IVehicle` with method `start()`. Then create:

- `Car` class implementing `IVehicle`
- `Bike` class implementing `IVehicle`
- `Driver` class that uses `IVehicle` in its constructor and calls `start()` and `"Driving..."`.

**Expected Output:**

```
Car is starting
Driving...
Bike is starting
Driving...

```

### **Q3: Swap Without Refactor**

**Problem Statement:**

You are given:

```
class PetrolEngine {
  start(): void {
    console.log("Petrol engine started");
  }
}

class Car {
  engine: PetrolEngine = new PetrolEngine();
  drive(): void {
    this.engine.start();
    console.log("Driving car");
  }
}

```

**Task:**
Explain why you **cannot** easily switch to a `DieselEngine` without modifying `Car`.

Then refactor it using an interface to show **loose coupling**.

---

### **Q4: Dynamic Switching of Strategy**

**Problem Statement:**

Create an interface `Vehicle` with a method `start()`.

- Implement `Bike` and `Car` classes that log appropriate `start()` messages.
- Create a `Driver` class that receives a `Vehicle` in its constructor and calls `drive()`.

**Then:** Add a `setVehicle()` method in `Driver` to switch between vehicles **at runtime**.

**Expected Output:**

```
Bike is starting
Driving...
Car is starting
Driving...

```

### **Q5: Create a Media Player System**

**Problem Statement:**

You're building a `MediaPlayer` class that plays different types of media files.

- Create an interface `MediaFile` with method `play()`
- Implement `AudioFile`, `VideoFile`, and `PDFFile`
- Create a `MediaPlayer` class that accepts any `MediaFile` and calls its `play()` method

**Expected Output:**

```
Playing audio file...
Playing video file...
Displaying PDF document...

```

**Goal:** Show **loose coupling via interface** allows plugging in any media type.

### **Q6: Notification System using Observer Pattern**

**Problem Statement:**

You are building a notification system where a `NotificationCenter` must notify multiple devices (`Smartphone`, `Tablet`) of updates.

- Create `Observer` interface with `update()` method
- Implement `Smartphone` and `Tablet` classes that log a message in `update()`
- Create a `NotificationCenter` class with:
    - `attach()`, `detach()`, and `notify()` methods
    - A list of `Observer` objects
- Allow devices to **subscribe or unsubscribe** and automatically get updates

**Expected Output:**

```
Observer added: Smartphone
Observer added: Tablet
Smartphone received notification
Tablet received notification

```

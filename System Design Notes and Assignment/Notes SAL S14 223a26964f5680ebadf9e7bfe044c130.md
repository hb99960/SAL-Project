# 1.0: CAP Theorem

### **CAP Theorem (Definition)**

The **CAP Theorem** states that **a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties at any given time**:

---

### **1. Consistency (C)**

Every read receives the **most recent write** or an **error**.

> All nodes return the same data even if accessed simultaneously.
> 

---

### **2. Availability (A)**

Every request receives a **non-error response**, even if it’s not the latest data.

> The system always responds, even during partial failures.
> 

---

### **3. Partition Tolerance (P)**

The system continues to **function despite communication failures** (network partitions) between nodes.

> Nodes can’t reach each other, but the system still works in some capacity.
> 

- Example: Banks prioritize **Consistency** and Partition Tolerance, ensuring users see the same account data across nodes. Social media platforms prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance, tolerating delays or inconsistency in feeds or messages.

## 2.0: Microservices & Messaging

### Monolith vs Microservices

| Monolith | Microservices |
| --- | --- |
| Single codebase | Split into multiple independent services |
| Tight coupling | Loose coupling |
| One deployment | Independent deployments |
| Hard to scale parts | Easily scale individual services |
| Example: One large app handles users, orders, and payments | Each handled by its own microservice |

---

### Refactoring to Microservices (Steps)

1. **Identify boundaries** — Separate concerns like auth, orders, payments.
2. **Extract modules** — Turn internal modules into APIs.
3. **Choose communication method** — REST, gRPC, or messaging queues.
4. **Add service discovery** — So services can find each other.
5. **Introduce gateway** — For routing external traffic.

---

### Microservices Design Patterns

- **Decomposition**: Split monolith into services by domain (e.g., User, Order).
- **Strangler Pattern**: Gradually replace monolith parts with microservices.
- **SAGA Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions through a series of local transactions.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separate read and write models for scalability.

---

### Messaging Queue

A messaging queue lets services talk **asynchronously** (not in real-time). It **decouples** sender and receiver.

- Producer → **Queue** → Consumer
- Reliable communication
- Used for background jobs, retry mechanisms, event-driven architecture

---

### Kafka vs RabbitMQ

| Feature | Kafka | RabbitMQ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Distributed log | Message broker |
| Message Order | Guaranteed | Not guaranteed by default |
| Use Case | High-throughput data streams | Task queues, background jobs |
| Persistence | Designed for long-term storage | Short-term, auto-deleted queues |
| Performance | Very high (writes in batches) | Medium |

---

### Zookeeper

- A **coordination service** for distributed systems.
- Used by Kafka for:
    - Leader election
    - Keeping metadata
    - Synchronization between nodes

---

## 3.0 Database Design & Caching

### SQL vs NoSQL

| SQL (Relational DB) | NoSQL (Non-relational DB) |
| --- | --- |
| Tables, rows | Documents, key-value, graphs |
| Schema-based | Schema-less |
| Strong consistency | Eventual consistency (mostly) |
| Use Case: Financial data | Use Case: Analytics, social feeds |

---

### Primary vs Replica

- **Primary**: The main database where writes happen.
- **Replica**: Read-only copy used for scaling reads.

> Used for read-heavy systems to reduce load on primary.
> 

---

### Consistency vs Availability

| Consistency | Availability |
| --- | --- |
| Data is always up-to-date | System always responds |
| May reject requests during failure | May serve outdated data |
| Suitable for financial apps | Suitable for social media feeds |

---

### Strong vs Eventual Consistency

- **Strong Consistency**:
Every read gets the latest write (e.g., Bank balance).
- **Eventual Consistency**:
Reads might be outdated for a short time, but all copies sync eventually (e.g., Instagram likes).

---

### Caching

- Stores **frequently accessed data** in memory (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Reduces DB hits → Improves latency and throughput.

**Types of Cache:**

- **Client-side**: Browser cache
- **Server-side**: App caches data before calling DB
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Caches static content closer to the user

**Common Strategies:**

- **Write-through**: Write to cache and DB at the same time
- **Write-back**: Write to cache first, then DB later
- **Cache eviction**: LRU (Least Recently Used), TTL (Time To Live)

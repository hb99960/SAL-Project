## Problem Statement : **Elevator Management System**

## **Objective**

Design and implement a **smart elevator control system** that efficiently manages multiple elevators in a building. The system should handle elevator requests from different floors, determine the best elevator to fulfill a request, and simulate elevator movements, door operations, and state transitions.

---

## **Functional Requirements**

### **Building & Elevator Setup**

- The system must support **multiple floors** and **multiple elevators**.
- Each elevator should start at **floor 1** and be able to move up or down.

### **Elevator Requests & Assignment**

- A **passenger can request an elevator** from any floor, specifying the desired destination.
- The system should determine the **best elevator** to serve a request based on:
    - The elevator’s current position.
    - The direction of travel (up or down).
    - The elevator’s idle status.

### **Elevator State Management**

- An elevator operates in **three states**:
    - **MovingState** → The elevator is in transit.
    - **OpenDoor** → The doors are open at a floor.
    - **CloseDoor** → The doors are closed, and the elevator is ready for movement.

### **Elevator Movement**

- The assigned elevator moves **one floor at a time** toward the requested floor.
- The elevator must **open its doors upon arrival** and close them after a delay.
- If an elevator is already moving in the **requested direction**, it should prioritize requests in the same direction.

### **Display & Monitoring**

- Each elevator should provide real-time updates:
    - Current floor.
    - Direction of movement.
    - Occupancy status.

---

## **Constraints & Edge Cases**

- If all elevators are occupied or moving in the opposite direction, **the request should be logged** for later assignment.
- If an elevator **is already at the requested floor**, doors should open immediately.
- Doors **should not open while the elevator is moving**.
- The system should handle **unexpected requests gracefully**.

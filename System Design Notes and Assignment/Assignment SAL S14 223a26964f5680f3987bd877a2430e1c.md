---

**3.** Which statement best explains a **trade-off between Strong and Eventual Consistency**?

A) Eventual consistency is better for all real-time applications
B) Strong consistency is faster than eventual consistency
C) Eventual consistency improves availability but may serve stale data

**Answer:** C

---

**4.** What would happen in a caching system using **write-back strategy** if the application crashes before syncing with DB?

A) Data is lost
B) Cache updates DB immediately
C) No data is affected

**5.** You are designing a **real-time bidding platform**. Which design pattern is the best fit for processing distributed transactions?

A) CQRS
B) Strangler
C) Saga
D) Decomposition

**Answer:** C

---

**6.** Which of the following is a valid reason to prefer **Kafka** over RabbitMQ?

A) Requires real-time ordering of short-lived tasks
B) Requires a distributed log for high-throughput streams
C) Needs simple RPC task execution
D) Suitable for low-latency mobile notifications

**Answer:** B

---

**7.** A system needs **low latency** and **high availability**, but can tolerate some inconsistency for a short time. What type of consistency is best?

A) Strong
B) Strict
C) Eventual
D) Snapshot

**Answer:** C

---

**8.** In the process of refactoring a monolith to microservices, the **Strangler Pattern** refers to:

**Answer:** B

---

**9.** You deployed a caching layer. After scaling your cache servers from 2 to 4, cache misses increased drastically. Which design flaw does this indicate?

A) Poor data modeling
B) Normal hashing instead of consistent hashing

**Answer:** B

---

**10.** Which trade-off is most accurate in high-scale distributed systems?

A) Higher consistency always leads to better latency
B) Increasing throughput always improves availability
C) To tolerate partitions, one must give up either availability or consistency

**Answer:** C

---

### **Part B: Descriptive Questions**

Write **brief but clear** answers (4–6 lines each).

---

**1.** Explain a real-world scenario where you would prefer **eventual consistency** over strong consistency. Why?

---

**2.** Describe a failure case in CAP theorem using an example of a messaging app that experiences a partition.

---

**3.** Compare **Kafka and RabbitMQ** in terms of persistence, use cases, and performance trade-offs.

---

**4.** You’ve just split a monolith into microservices. What **new concerns** might arise in communication, deployment, and debugging?

---

**5.** Imagine a user-facing application using a write-through cache strategy. What benefits and limitations does it bring in terms of latency, consistency, and fault tolerance?

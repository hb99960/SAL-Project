**Notes: Duck Simulation App with OOP & Design Principles**

Session notes: [S03](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/9d9ed914-a699-42a7-83a5-d41c3f264aac/nDGVVbMrOsx1zjGd.png)

## 1. Abstract vs Concrete

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Abstract | Blueprint or idea — What should be done (not how) |
| Concrete | Real implementation — How it is done |

**Analogy**:
Abstract class = Blueprint
Concrete class = Actual Building

---

## 2. Design Principle: Encapsulate What Varies

**Goal**: Isolate and manage parts of the system that change often (like duck behaviors).

Instead of writing code like this:

```
if (duckType === "rubber") {
  // no fly, no sound
}

```

A better way is to:

- Extract varying behavior (e.g., flying, quacking) into separate classes.
- Use composition instead of inheritance.

---

## 3. The Problem (Bloated Duck Class)

As more duck types (Rubber, Wooden, Mallard, etc.) were added:

- Too many if-else checks.
- Duplicated behavior (fly, quack, swim).
- Hard to extend without modifying the base class.
- Violated the Open-Closed Principle.
- Frequent merge conflicts in larger teams.

---

## 4. Solution: Interfaces for Reusable Behavior

Create fly behaviors with a common interface:

```
interface Flyable {
  fly(): string;
}

class FlyNoWay implements Flyable {
  fly() {
    return "Sorry I don't fly!!";
  }
}

class FlyWithWings implements Flyable {
  fly() {
    return "I fly with wings";
  }
}

```

Now these classes can be reused across any duck.

---

## 5. Public vs Private

| Keyword | Accessibility | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| public | Accessible everywhere | To expose properties or methods |
| private | Accessible only within class | To protect internal data/logic |
| protected | Accessible in class and subclasses | For inheritance scenarios |

Example:

```
class Duck {
  public flyable: Flyable;
  private age: number;
}

```

---

## 6. Setting Behavior Dynamically

You can change behavior at runtime:

```
const myDuck = new Duck(new FlyNoWay(), new MuteQuack());
myDuck.setFlyBehaviour(new FlyWithWings());  // now it flies!

```

This approach follows the Strategy Pattern.

---

## 7. Abstract Class vs Concrete Class

| Feature | Abstract Class | Concrete Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instantiation | Not allowed | Allowed |
| Abstract methods allowed | Yes | No |
| Concrete methods allowed | Yes | Yes |
| Use case | Share code and enforce subclass rules | Create complete usable objects |

Example:

```
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;
  move(): void {
    console.log("Moving...");
  }
}

```

---

## 8. Polymorphism

**Definition**: The ability to take many forms, using the same interface with different behaviors.

### Types of Polymorphism

| Type | Description | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Method Overloading | Same method name, different parameters | Compile-time |
| Method Overriding | Child class redefines a parent method | Runtime |
| Object Substitution | Parent reference refers to child object | Runtime |

**Real-life analogy**:
A printer prints different formats like PDFs, Word documents, or photos — all using the same method `print()`, but each with different logic.

---

## 9. Using Supertypes (Program to Interface or Abstract Class)

### Options:

- Interface
- Abstract class
- Regular class

Examples:

```
// Interface
interface Animal {
  makeSound(): void;
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Bark");
  }
}

// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;
}

```

This enables flexibility and extendability.

---

## 10. Interface vs Abstract Class

| Feature | Interface | Abstract Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Method types | All methods are abstract | Can have both abstract and concrete |
| Object creation | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| Supports multiple inheritance | Yes | No |
| Preferred use case | Enforcing structure only | Reuse code + enforce some structure |

---

## Summary Table: Polymorphism

| Type | Also Known As | Resolved At | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Method Overloading | Static Polymorphism | Compile-Time | `greet(name)` vs `greet(name, age)` |
| Method Overriding | Dynamic Polymorphism | Runtime | Subclass modifies inherited method |
| Object Substitution | Subtype Polymorphism | Runtime | `Duck d = new RubberDuck()` |

## Project: Duck Simulation Game

- Reuse behaviors with interfaces like `Flyable`, `Quackable`.
- Create an abstract `Duck` class to define common structure.
- Create concrete duck types (IndianDuck, RubberDuck, etc.).
- Encapsulate behaviors to avoid code duplication.
- Follow principles like Open-Closed, Strategy Pattern, and Polymorphism.

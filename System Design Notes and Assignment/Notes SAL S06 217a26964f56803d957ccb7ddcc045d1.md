Session Notes: [S06](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/99cddb94-d893-4f7a-9b22-b4185d277772/mcukIlFjqLGrKuzO.png)

## 1. Problem Statement: Beverage Customization System

In a cafe, customers can order various beverages like **tea** or **coffee**. These beverages can be enhanced with ingredients such as **honey**, **sugar**, or **whipped cream**.

### Requirements:

- Each beverage must have a **description** and a **cost**.
- Users can **customize** beverages with zero or more ingredients.
- Cost should update **dynamically** based on ingredients added.
- The system must follow **OOP principles** and be **extensible** for new beverages and ingredients.

---

## 2. Objective of the System

- Allow creation of various **base beverages** with their base prices.
- Use **decorators** to add ingredients like honey, sugar, etc.
- **Compute final cost** and show **full description** after customizations.
- Ensure **extensibility** without modifying core beverage classes.

---

## 3. Why Decorator Pattern?

- The **Decorator Pattern** allows behavior to be **dynamically added or removed** from an object at runtime.
- It helps achieve **flexibility**, **modularity**, and adheres to the **Open/Closed Principle**.
- Instead of modifying or extending the base class, decorators **wrap** it to add functionality.

---

## 4. Core Design Approach

### Class Types Used:

1. **Abstract Beverage Class**
2. **Concrete Beverages** (e.g., Margherita, Farmhouse)
3. **Abstract Topping Decorator**
4. **Concrete Toppings** (e.g., Cheese, Olives, Jalapeno)
5. **Client Code** to assemble and order

### Design Decision:

We use **inheritance** here to ensure that each decorator behaves like a beverage (has `getDescription()` and `getCost()` methods), allowing nested wrapping.

---

## 5. Code Implementation

```
// Abstract base class
abstract class Pizza {
  abstract getDescription(): string;
  abstract getCost(): number;
}

// Concrete base classes
class Margherita extends Pizza {
  getDescription() { return "Margherita"; }
  getCost() { return 150; }
}

class Farmhouse extends Pizza {
  getDescription() { return "Farmhouse"; }
  getCost() { return 200; }
}

// Abstract topping decorator
abstract class ToppingDecorator extends Pizza {
  constructor(protected pizza: Pizza) { super(); }
  abstract getDescription(): string;
  abstract getCost(): number;
}

// Concrete Toppings
class Cheese extends ToppingDecorator {
  getDescription() { return this.pizza.getDescription() + " + Cheese"; }
  getCost() { return this.pizza.getCost() + 40; }
}

class Olives extends ToppingDecorator {
  getDescription() { return this.pizza.getDescription() + " + Olives"; }
  getCost() { return this.pizza.getCost() + 30; }
}

class Jalapeno extends ToppingDecorator {
  getDescription() { return this.pizza.getDescription() + " + Jalapeno"; }
  getCost() { return this.pizza.getCost() + 25; }
}

```

### Client Code Example

```
const myPizza = new Cheese(new Cheese(new Olives(new Margherita())));

console.log("Order:", myPizza.getDescription()); // Margherita + Olives + Cheese + Cheese
console.log("Total Cost: ₹", myPizza.getCost()); // ₹220

```

---

## 6. Class Diagram

*Use UML to show:*

- `Pizza` is the base component.
- `Margherita` and `Farmhouse` inherit `Pizza`.
- `ToppingDecorator` also inherits `Pizza`.
- `Cheese`, `Olives`, etc., inherit `ToppingDecorator`.

---

## 7. Real-World Analogy: Car Customization

Customers build a **custom car** starting from a **BasicCar** and dynamically adding upgrades like:

- **Performance:** Turbocharger, Carbon Fiber
- **Luxury:** Leather Seats, Sound System
- **Safety:** Blind-Spot Monitoring
- **Tech:** Auto-Parking, 360° Camera

Decorators allow upgrades to be **added dynamically**, **combined flexibly**, and **stacked** without modifying the core `Car` class.

---

## 8. Benefits of Decorator Pattern

1. **Runtime flexibility**: Add/remove features as needed.
2. **Avoids subclass explosion**: No need to create many variants.
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: Easily add new toppings/upgrades.
4. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each decorator has a specific purpose.

---

## 9. Limitations of Decorator Pattern

1. **Debugging is harder** when many decorators are layered.
2. **Order of decorators** may impact output.
3. **Initial setup** of multiple decorators may look complex or verbose.

---

## 10. When to Use and Avoid

### Use Decorator Pattern when:

- You need to **add behaviors dynamically**.
- You want to **reuse and combine** features flexibly.
- You want to follow **clean OOP design principles**.

### Avoid Decorator Pattern when:

- There are only a few fixed options.
- Behavior doesn't change—only appearance or cost.
- Simplicity and speed are prioritized.

## 11. Comparison with Other Patterns

| Design Choice | Use When... |
| --- | --- |
| Strategy Pattern | You want to change complete behavior |
| Decorator Pattern | You want to **extend** existing behavior |
| Inheritance | You know all behaviors **at compile-time** |
| Interface | You only want to **enforce structure/contract** |

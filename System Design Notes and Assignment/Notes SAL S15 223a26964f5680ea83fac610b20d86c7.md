Session Notes : [S15](https://coding-platform.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/lms/tickets/01558ee1-796d-4d87-bb81-ea2ca5b2d0f8/g1dUUqnLzbqjaxnu.png)

# **URL Shortener**

A **URL Shortener** takes a long URL and generates a much shorter, unique version (e.g., `bit.ly/x1Yz23`). When accessed, this short URL redirects the user to the original long URL.

### üîπ Core Concepts

- **Encode the long URL** into a short ID (using hashing, UUID, or base62 encoding).
- **Store mapping** of `shortID ‚Üí longURL` in a database.
- **Redirect API** fetches the original URL and responds with a `301/302` HTTP redirect.

### üîπ Components

- **POST /shorten** ‚Üí Accepts a long URL and returns a short one.
- **GET /\:shortID** ‚Üí Redirects to the original URL.
- **Database** to store mappings: `shortID` as key, `longURL` as value.
- Optional: Track analytics like clicks, country, device type.

### üîπ ID Generation Approaches

- **Hashing** (MD5, SHA-256): May cause collisions; needs deduplication.
- **UUID**: Large, unique, but not very short.
- **Base62 Encoding**: Converts a number (like a counter) into a short string using 62 characters (A‚ÄìZ, a‚Äìz, 0‚Äì9).
- **Zookeeper** (or other coordination services) can generate consistent, unique IDs in a distributed system.

### üîπ Redirect Type

- **301 (Permanent Redirect)**: SEO-friendly; tells browsers to cache.
- **302 (Temporary Redirect)**: No caching; good for testing or temporary links.

### üîπ Storage

- Short mappings are stored in fast-access databases (e.g., Redis, Cassandra, or relational DB).
- For massive scale, use a **partitioned/sharded database**.

# **Scalable APIs: Keyword Frequency Search**

A **scalable API** handles increasing traffic smoothly ‚Äî whether it's 10 users or 10 million. Design involves structuring the system so it remains fast, reliable, and available under heavy load.

### What makes an API scalable?

- Can **seve more requests** without slowing down.

Here are **clear, student-friendly notes** on designing **Scalable APIs** using the given keyword-frequency problem as a practical case study. This covers both **System Design** concepts and **Backend Engineering** decisions.

---

### **Problem Statement**

You‚Äôre building a system where:

- Each text file is large (\~50GB) and there are 50‚Äì100 such files.
- Millions of users can search for a **keyword** and get its **total frequency** across all files.
- API should respond in **milliseconds**.

This tests your understanding of:

- File storage
- Efficient preprocessing
- Caching
- Scaling and backend architecture

---

## 1. **Storing Large Text Files**

- You **cannot load full files into memory** due to size.
- Store files in **Object Storage** like:
    - AWS S3
    - Google Cloud Storage
    - Local file system (for prototype)

### Bonus:

Use **event-driven triggers** (e.g., S3 ‚Üí Lambda) to process files **asynchronously** when they are uploaded or modified.

---

## 2. **How to Store Word Frequencies**

### Use **Redis**:

- In-memory key-value store ‚Äî perfect for fast lookups.
- Store as:
    
    ```
    { "apple": 125000 }
    { "machine learning": 3342 }
    
    ```
    
- Why Redis?
    - Low latency (sub-millisecond)
    - Easy to scale (via Redis Cluster)
    - Supports TTL, pub-sub, and atomic updates

---

## 3. **Scaling the System**

### A. **API Layer**

- Deploy multiple API servers (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Use a **Load Balancer** to evenly route user requests

### B. **Data Layer**

- Use **Redis Cluster** for distributed in-memory storage
- Optional: Use MongoDB for backup or historical audit

---

## 4. **Keyword Normalization**

You must handle:

- `Apple` vs `apple` vs `Apples` vs `apples`

### Preprocessing Steps:

- Convert to **lowercase**
- Remove **punctuation and special characters**
- Optionally, apply **stemming/lemmatization**

> Example: Apples. ‚Üí apple
> 

---

## 5. **Bonus: Phrases & N-gram Search**

If users search **phrases** like:

- `"machine learning"`
- `"apple is red"`

You need to:

- Index **2-grams** or **3-grams** during parsing
- Store `{ "machine learning": count }` in Redis

üîÅ For advanced search, switch to a **full-text search engine** like **Elasticsearch**

---

## 6. **Dynamic Updates: What if New Files Are Added?**

- Use a **Cron Job** or **Trigger** to reprocess and update Redis when:
    - New file is uploaded
    - Existing file is edited
- Maintain **idempotent processing** so counts don‚Äôt get corrupted

---

## 7. **API Security: Rate Limiting**

Prevent abuse by:

- Adding a **rate limiter** per user/IP
- Redis supports rate limiting via **Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket algorithms**

Also add:

- API Keys or Auth Tokens
- HTTPS enforcement

---

# How to Identify the Problem

| Round Type | What to Expect |
| --- | --- |
| **System Design** | Think in components: Storage, Processing, Querying, Scaling |
| **DSA + Backend** | Show how you'd handle big data and API scale |
| **Application Round** | Emphasis on engineering choices and clean architecture |

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Store large files externally; never load them in memory during query.
- Preprocess once ‚Üí store counts in Redis.
- API should only **read from Redis**, not reprocess.
- Normalize keywords for accurate matching.
- Use **Redis + horizontal scaling** to support millions of users.
- Secure with rate-limiting and token-based access.

## 1.0 Concept: Tight Coupling vs Loose Coupling

### What is Tight Coupling?

- When one class is **heavily dependent** on another.
- You cannot change one class without affecting the other.
- Difficult to test and extend.

**Example:**

```
class Engine {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine started");
  }
}

class Car {
  private engine = new Engine(); // Tight Coupling

  drive() {
    this.engine.start();
    console.log("Car is driving");
  }
}

```

- **Problem**: Car is directly creating and depending on Engine.

---

### What is Loose Coupling?

- Classes are **connected through abstraction** (like interfaces).
- You can change components without modifying the whole system.
- Easier to test, extend, and maintain.

---

### Composition with Class (Still some coupling)

```
class Engine {
  start(): void {
    console.log("Engine started");
  }
}

class Car {
  private engine: Engine;

  constructor(engine: Engine) {
    this.engine = engine; // Injected from outside
  }

  drive(): void {
    this.engine.start();
    console.log("Car is driving");
  }
}

const car = new Car(new Engine());
car.drive();

```

- `Car` delegates behavior to `Engine` without knowing its internal details.
- This reduces coupling compared to tight coupling.

---

### Composition with Interface (Loose Coupling)

```
interface Vehicle {
  start(): void;
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
  start() {
    console.log("Car is starting");
  }
}

class Bike implements Vehicle {
  start() {
    console.log("Bike is starting");
  }
}

class Driver {
  constructor(private vehicle: Vehicle) {}

  drive() {
    this.vehicle.start();
    console.log("Driving...");
  }
}

```

**Why is this better?**

- Driver doesn’t care what the vehicle is — as long as it follows the `Vehicle` interface.
- Easily swap `Car` or `Bike`.

---

## 2.0 Strategy Pattern (UML & Code)

### Concept:

- Instead of writing multiple `if-else`, we define multiple interchangeable **strategies** (classes with common behavior).

**Class Diagram Style:**

---

## 3.0 Observer Design Pattern – Loose Coupling in Action

### Problem Context:

You’re building a system like a **weather station** or **YouTube notification system**, where many devices need updates.

- Central system: **WeatherStation**
- Dependent devices: **Smartphone**, **Tablet**
- Devices should be able to **subscribe/unsubscribe** any time.

---

### Observer Pattern Flow:

- `Subject` = broadcaster
- `Observer` = devices
- `Subject` has a list of observers.
- Whenever an update happens → all observers are **automatically notified**.

---

### Code Breakdown:

### 1. Interfaces:

```
interface Subject {
  attach(observer: Observer): void;
  detach(observer: Observer): void;
  notify(): void;
}

interface Observer {
  update(subject: Subject): void;
}

```

### 2. Concrete Subject:

```
class WeatherStation implements Subject {
  private observers: Observer[] = [];

  attach(observer: Observer): void {
    if (!this.observers.includes(observer)) {
      this.observers.push(observer);
      console.log("Attached an observer.");
    }
  }

  detach(observer: Observer): void {
    const index = this.observers.indexOf(observer);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.observers.splice(index, 1);
      console.log("Detached an observer.");
    }
  }

  notify(): void {
    for (const observer of this.observers) {
      observer.update(this);
    }
  }

  listAllObservers(): void {
    console.log(this.observers);
  }
}

```

### 3. Concrete Observers:

```
class Smartphone implements Observer {
  update(subject: Subject): void {
    console.log("Smartphone received update from:", subject);
  }
}

class Tablet implements Observer {
  update(subject: Subject): void {
    console.log("Tablet received update from:", subject);
  }
}

```

### 4. Client Code:

```
const weatherStation = new WeatherStation();

const harshitPhone = new Smartphone();
const dinkarTablet = new Tablet();

weatherStation.attach(harshitPhone);
weatherStation.attach(dinkarTablet);

weatherStation.notify();       // All observers notified
weatherStation.listAllObservers();

```

## Applications of Observer Pattern

1. **Messaging Systems** (WhatsApp, Telegram notifications)
2. **Live Scoreboards** (ESPN, CricBuzz)
3. **Real-Time Stock Market Dashboards**
4. **IoT Systems** (Weather sensors, smart homes)
5. **Collaboration Tools** (Google Docs real-time sync)

---

## Benefits

1. **Loose Coupling**: Subject doesn't care who is observing.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Add new observers without changing subject.
3. **Runtime Flexibility**: Add or remove observers anytime.

---

## Limitation

- **Notification Order** is not guaranteed.
- Can become hard to debug with many subscribers.

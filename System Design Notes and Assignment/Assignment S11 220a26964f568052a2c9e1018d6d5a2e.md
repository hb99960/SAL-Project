# Assignment S11

**3. 

### Problem Statement:

You are developing a **Pizza Ordering System** where customers can customize their pizzas by choosing different ingredients. Implement the **Builder Pattern** to allow the step-by-step construction of a **Pizza** object with the following properties:

- `size` (small, medium, or large)
- `cheese` (boolean)
- `pepperoni` (boolean)
- `mushrooms` (boolean)

The **PizzaBuilder** class should allow setting these properties step by step and finally build the `Pizza` object. Demonstrate its usage in the `main` function by creating a **large pizza with cheese and mushrooms** and printing its details.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure the implementation follows the **Builder Pattern** strictly.

### Problem Statement:

You are working on a **game development project** where multiple characters with similar attributes need to be created. Instead of creating them from scratch, implement the **Prototype Pattern** to **clone existing characters** efficiently.

Define a `GameCharacter` class with the following properties:

- `name` (string)
- `level` (integer)
- `weapon` (string)

Implement a method `clone()` in the class to create and return a **copy** of an existing `GameCharacter` object.

Demonstrate its usage in the `main` function by:

1. Creating a character named **"Warrior"** with **level 10** and **sword** as the weapon.
2. Cloning this character to create another character **"Warrior Clone"** and printing both objects to show they are separate instances.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure the implementation strictly follows the **Prototype Pattern**.

### Problem Statement:

You are developing an **online car showroom** where customers can customize their cars before purchasing. Implement the **Builder Pattern** for creating a `Car` object with the following properties:

- `brand` (string)
- `engine` (string)
- `color` (string)
- `sunroof` (boolean)
- `automaticTransmission` (boolean)

The **CarBuilder** class should provide methods to **incrementally set** these properties and finally build the `Car` object.

Demonstrate its usage in the `main` function by:

1. Creating a **Tesla Model S with an electric engine, black color, sunroof, and automatic transmission**.
2. Printing the car details.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- The implementation should strictly follow the **Builder Pattern**.

### Problem Statement: Debugging a Faulty Prototype Implementation

A **Prototype Pattern** is already implemented for creating **Books** in a library system, but it has a bug that causes the cloned books to **share memory reference** instead of creating a **deep copy**.

Here is the buggy `Book` class:

```tsx

class Book {
    String title;
    String author;
    List<String> reviews;

    public Book(String title, String author, List<String> reviews) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.reviews = reviews;
    }

    public Book clone() {
        return new Book(this.title, this.author, this.reviews);
    }
}
```

Your task is to **fix the clone method** so that when cloning a book, the `reviews` list is also **deep copied**, ensuring that modifying one book's reviews does not affect the cloned book.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure that cloned objects are **completely independent** from the original.

### Problem Statement:

You are designing a **device manufacturing system** where multiple types of devices (e.g., **Laptops and Phones**) are produced by different brands (**Apple and Samsung**). Implement the **Abstract Factory Pattern** to create objects dynamically based on the brand and device type.

Your implementation should have:

1. **Abstract Factory (`DeviceFactory`)**
    - Method: `createDevice(String type)`
2. **Concrete Factories (`AppleFactory` and `SamsungFactory`)**
    - Implement `DeviceFactory` and return respective device objects.
3. **Device Interface (`Device`)**
    - Method: `specifications()` (Prints the device details)
4. **Concrete Devices (`AppleLaptop`, `ApplePhone`, `SamsungLaptop`, `SamsungPhone`)**
    - Implement `Device` and provide custom specifications.

Demonstrate the pattern in the `main` function by:

1. Creating an **Apple Laptop** and a **Samsung Phone** using the respective factories.
2. Printing their specifications.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure that the implementation follows the **Abstract Factory Pattern** correctly.
